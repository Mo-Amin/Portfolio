        <div id="paragraph">
          <p>
            My name is Mohamed-Amin Cheaito, and I am a 4th year undergrad at
            Portland State University. I’ve worked on many projects whether that
            be for the university or personal. I'm a huge basketball fan so the
            main theme of my personal projects revolve around basketball, as you
            can see from the projects within the projects section. Overall, I’m
            not 100% set on what I want to do professionally after I graduate, I
            know however that I want to be a software developer. It doesn’t
            really matter what the job would focus on but if I had to choose, I
            would like to become a web/mobile developer because I really enjoy
            working on web/mobile applications.
