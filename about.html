        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Mohamed-Amin Cheaito, and I am a 4th year undergrad at
          Portland State University. I’ve worked on many projects whether that
          be for the university or personal. The main theme of my personal
          projects revolve around basketball, for example me and my friends were
          in an adult league last summer and we wanted to keep our stats, so I
          decided to build my own using Google firebase’s database, react native
          and expo. It was a fun project that taught me a variety of skills.
          Overall, I’m not 100% set on what I want to do professionally after I
          graduate, I know however that I want to be a software developer. It
          doesn’t really matter what the job would focus on but if I had to
          choose, I would like to become a web/mobile developer because I really
          enjoy working on web/mobile applications.
